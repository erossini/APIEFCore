# Using Entity Framework Core via APIs with complex objects

I want to give a complete example of minimal APIs in Blazor with Entity Framework Core with complex objects. I always struggle to have a solution working when my model has dependencies with other object. Here I show my test and my code. The code is in [NET9](https://puresourcecode.com/category/dotnet/net9/). In the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/update-related-data?view=aspnetcore-9.0), there are some examples but it is not complex enough. A few days ago, [I posted about another problem](https://puresourcecode.com/dotnet/net9/pendingmodelchangeswarning-with-net9/) I had with NET9 and Entity Framework Core.
